1. Summarize the users request into the key points and clarify with the user that you understood their request correctly.
2. Carefully analyze their request.
   - Ask any follow up questions
   - Find and study all related code, dependencies, documentation
   - Conduct any necessary external research. etc
3. Propose the most simple, minimal, and effective solution you can come up to the user.
4. Analyze their thoughts and feedback, repeating step 2 and 3 as necessary.
5. Ask the user for permission to proceed with implementation.
6. Upon user consent, proceed to implement the changes, stopping at various intervals to get user feedback on key changes.
